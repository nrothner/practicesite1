  <h1>Hello, Welcome to my first HTML practice site!</h1>
  <h2>About me, Nicole Rothner</h2>
  <p>Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Nicole Rothner and I'm currently a self taught front end developer studying UX Design at George Mason University. I work in a variety of platforms including WordPress (Divi Theme), SharePoint 2016, SharePoint 2019, SharePoint Online, Drupal, and HTML/CSS sites.</p>><br>
  <p>My role often involves editing HTML documents, and everything I have learned has been on the job. I'm interested in this course because I have had no formal training.</p><br>
  <p>My interests include rock climbing, hiking, and spending time with my friends. I'm hoping to learn the fundementals of development which I'm missing in my knowledge. I'm hoping to be able to take the opportuntiy to start using some JavaScript as well.</p>
