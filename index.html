  <h1>Hello, Welcome to my first HTML practice site!</h1>
  <h2>About me, Nicole Rothner</h2>
  <p>Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Nicole Rothner and I'm currently a self taught front end developer studying Human&nbsp;Factors &amp; Applied&nbsp;Cognition at George Mason University. I work in a variety of platforms including WordPress (Divi Theme), SharePoint 2016, SharePoint 2019, SharePoint Online, Drupal, and occasionally HTML/CSS sites.</p>
  <p>My role often involves editing HTML documents, and everything I have learned has been on the job. I'm interested in this course because I have had <i>no formal training.</i></p>
  <p><b>My interests include:</b></p>
   <li>Rock climbing</li>
   <li>Hiking</li>
   <li>Spending time with my friends</li> 
	<p>I'm hoping to learn the fundementals of development which I'm missing in my knowledge. I plan to take the opportuntiy to start using some JavaScript as well.</p>
