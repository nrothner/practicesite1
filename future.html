	<h2>Future Plans</h2>
	<p>In the future, I plan to pursue a career in UX Development. I have a passion around UX as well as Web Developement and didn't want to make a choice between the two so I'm hoping to combine both fields.</p>
	<p>I'm excited to learn to use GitHub for the purpose of this course as it was always something I was intimidated by and never had a reason to learn. Additionally, although I can use CSS, I never have a reason to use it when most sites I edit are already built for me. I often use in line styles and am looking forward to actually using a style sheet.</p>
