	<h1>Future Plans</h1>
	<p>In the future, I plan to pursue a career in UX Development. I have a passion around UX as well as Web Developement. I can truly say I love learning.</p>
	<p>After graduate school, I hope to complete a certificate in web development to dive deeper into the field.</p>
	<p>I'm excited to learn to use GitHub for the purpose of this course as it was always something I was intimidated by and never had a reason to learn. Additionally, although I can use CSS, I have also never have a reason to use it when most sites I edit are already built for me. I often use in line styles and am looking forward to actually using a real style sheet. I've taught myself JavaScript but also never really applied it for a purpose.</p>
	<p>I think this course will help me fill in all the gaps in my knowledge that have been missing.</p>
