<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate Degree</h3>
<p>In 2016 I graduated from the University of Delaware with a <i>Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with minors in Cognitive Science and Advertising.</i>. I was known to change my major about every semester as I could not decide what career I wanted to pursue. If I was interested in a field, I would take an introductory course to get some exposure. Some of my previous tracks include:</p>
	<li>Pre-Veterinary Medicine</li>
	<li>Pre-Surgery</li>
	<li>Cognitive Science <i>Linguistics</i></li>
	<li>Cognitive Science <i>Audiology</i></li>
	<li>Marketing</li>
	<li>Human Computer Interaction</li>
<p>It wasn't until I took Human Computer Interaction my senior year that I was introduced to coding. My professor had us use a program called <b>LiveCode</b> to develop applications. Ours almost made it to the app store but we ran into some issues along the way. Ultimately, we decided not to pursue it but I caught the coding bug and discovered my passion.</p>
<p>After graduation, I decided to spend my summer teaching myself how to code. Optimistic and ignorant, I only started learning JavaScript based on a friend's recommendation. It wasn't until much later on, I learned you actually needed HTML and CSS to give your JavaScript something to work with. I received a job offer early the next year to work in Human Resources, so I put my dreams on hold to start my life.</p>

<h3>Graduate Degree (in progress)</h3>
<p>Fast foward 3 years and I began a Graduate degree at George Mason University with the goal of working towards UX Development. I'm about half way through my degree and really enjoying the experience so far. I've been able to build a lot of great skills and even particpate and win a competition called the Usabil-a-thon.</p>
