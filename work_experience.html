<h1>Work Experience</h1>

<p>I began a job as a HR Analyst in February 2017. I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot of great new skills to help me in industry and had my first exposure to the corporate world.</p>

<h2>March 2018 - Introduction to WordPress</h2>
<p>In March 2018 I was brought onto a project where I was quickly thrown into maintaining a WordPress site using the Divi Theme and also stewarding a Drupal website. Both sites very quickly turned into my favorite part of my job and I wanted to keep working with them. The great thing about both platforms is <i>coding was optional!</i> For a beginner, I thought they were both extremely managable to maintain. Through countless hours of working on sites, the WordPress SME and I became close friends and she was starting to pass along some projects. I loved working with her and really wanted to have her job more than mine.</p>
