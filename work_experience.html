<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<h3>February 2017 - Human Resources Analyst</h3>
<p>I began a job as a HR Analyst in February 2017. I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot of great new skills to help me in industry.
<h3>March 2018 - Introduction to WordPress</h3>
<p>In March 2018 I was brought onto a project where I was quickly thrown into maintaining a WordPress site using the Divi Theme and also stewarding a Drupal website. Both sites very quickly turned into my favorite part of my job and I wanted to keep working with them. The great thing about both platforms is <i>coding was optional!</i> For a beginner, I thought they were both managable. Through countless hours of working on sites, the WordPress SME and I became close friends and she was starting to pass along some projects. I loved working with her and really wanted her job more than mine.</p>
<h3>August 2019 - Becoming a Web Developer</h3>
<p>After a long journey and working hard, I was offered my current positio n as a web developer and intranet steward. I know I was hired based on my reputation of being a quick learner and building my network. Since starting the position I have learned:
	<li>SharePoint (2016, 2019, Online)</li>
	<li>Office 365</li>
	<li>Editing existing HTML/CSS sites</li>
	<li>Many other internal corporate applications</li></p>
